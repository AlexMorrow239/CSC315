# Banknote Authentication Analysis

## Introduction
This Python-based project focuses on the classification of banknotes as real or counterfeit using the Banknote Authentication dataset. It showcases data analysis and visualization techniques, including the use of matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and scipy libraries to understand and predict the authenticity of banknotes.

## Features
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizes matplotlib to generate scatter plots, highlighting the distinctions between real and counterfeit banknotes.
- **Centroid Calculation:** Employs numpy and pandas to calculate centroids for both real and counterfeit banknotes, aiding in visualization and classification.
- **Euclidean Distance Classifier:** Implements a basic classifier based on the Euclidean distance to centroids for an initial guess of authenticity.
- **Gaussian Probability Density Classifier:** (Extra Credit) Enhances classification accuracy using a Gaussian probability density function to predict banknote authenticity.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip3 install matplotlib numpy pandas scipy
```
