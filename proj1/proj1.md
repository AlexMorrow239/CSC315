# Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pokemon Battle Simulator! This project is a text-based simulation game developed in Python that lets you engage in battles using classic Pokemon characters. As a player, you'll decide the actions of your Pikachu in a battle against a wild Bulbasaur, choosing between different moves to either defeat or catch it. This project is designed to illustrate basic programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, control structures, randomness, and user interaction.

## Features

- Engage in a text-based Pokemon battle.
- Choose from different actions for Pikachu, including Tackle, Sand Attack, or attempting to catch Bulbasaur with a Pokeball.
- Experience dynamic gameplay where outcomes depend on strategy and a bit of luck.
